# SchnapsOMeter

This is the Fritzing Schnaps-O-Meter. I developed it back in my Fritzing Days. It is basically an Arduino witch attached ethanol sensor MQ3 and a 60 LED strip of NeoPixels. 

# Function
Drink alkohol, blow onto the sensor, the lights will go up the more drunken you are. Have fun and drink responsibly ;-)
